        An encapsulation of software and configuration that BOSH can deploy to the cloud. You can think of a
        deployment as the state of a collection of VMs: what software is on them, what resources they use, and how
        these are orchestrated. Even though BOSH creates the deployment using ephemeral resources, the deployment is
        stable in that BOSH re-creates VMs that fail and otherwise works to keep your software running. BOSH also
        manages persistent disks so that state (for example, database data files) can survive when BOSH re-creates a
        VM. A particular combination of manifest, stemcell, and release is portable across different kinds of cloud
        infrastructure (that is, across different CPIs) with minimal changes to the manifest.
